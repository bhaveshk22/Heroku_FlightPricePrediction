# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a 'Flight Price Prediction' model. It uses various features such as airlines, date of journey, source, destination, and stops to predict flight prices. The goal of this project is to assist users in finding the best-priced flights.





## Roadmap

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The first step involved cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Training**: I experimented with different machine learning algorithms including ExtraTreesRegressor, Random Forests, Catboost, LightGBM and XGBoost. Each model was trained and validated using cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. This helped in identifying the most accurate model for prediction.
## Lessons Learned

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning concepts to a real-world problem. It was particularly interesting to see how different algorithms performed on the same task and how model performance can be optimized.
